# tdd-sign-up-assignment

Describe The Wall application. Think about how you built the wall. How many features did you create for the wall? You should be able to describe a certain feature, letâ€™s say login, and come up with multiple it statements (sub features like notification, redirect, validation, etc.) for these major features for the wall. Come up with test cases like how you would manually test an app:

Can /login render the login view?
Can the user login?
Can the user register?
Can the user log out? etc.

Write at least 30 it and at least 5 describe statements for this wall app. Write down all the pending it statements (or pending tests) located in the **/test** folder. Run **npm test** command in a separate shell to see all your pending tests output.

# Instructions

1. You will need to run the node server first before running any tests. 
2. Make sure you work on this assignment in a docker container. The necessarily files to build and run this app in a docker container is already provided.
3. Come up with **at least 10 pending tests.**
4. Once done, you need to zip your app in one file and upload the zipped file in Hacker Hero.
